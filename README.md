Privacy Policy – Passbild Pro
Last updated: 1 September 2025

Thank you for choosing Passbild Pro (“the App”, “we”, “our”). Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what information the App touches, how it is processed, and why no personal data is permanently stored on servers under our control.

Information the App Touches
1.1 Photos
• The photo you select (from your camera or photo library) is processed entirely on your device to create passport-size images that comply with German biometric standards.
• Cropping, background replacement, head-size checks, and colour correction are performed with Apple Vision and Core Image frameworks; no copy of the image leaves your device unless you explicitly export or share it.

1.2 Saved Projects (Optional)
• If you generate a Passbild the image and its layout settings are stored only in the App’s private container on your device (and, if you have iCloud Backup enabled, inside your own iCloud account).
• We cannot see, access, or retrieve these files.

1.3 Purchase Records (Optional)
• If you buy Tokens or do other in-app purchases, Apple provides us with an anonymised transaction receipt that contains no personal identifiers. The receipt is stored in your device-local Keychain solely so the App knows that you have already paid.

1.4 Diagnostics (Optional)
• When you opt in to Apple’s “Share With App Developers”, Apple may forward de-identified crash logs and usage statistics. These logs do not include photos or any information that could directly identify you.

2. How We Use This Information

• To generate biometric-compliant passport photos you request.
• To remember your unlocked features after an in-app purchase.
We do not use any information for advertising, tracking, or profiling.

3. Where Your Data Lives

• Your device – original and edited photos, saved projects, purchase receipts.
• Apple iCloud (only if you have iCloud Backup turned on) – encrypted device backup that includes the App’s data.
We run no servers that store personal data, and the App never uploads your photos to us or to third parties.

4. Your Rights & Choices

Because all personal content remains under your control, you can:

• Delete photos or projects at any time from within the App or the Photos app.
• Remove the App to erase local files and Keychain receipts; you may also delete the App’s iCloud backup in iOS Settings ▸ Apple ID ▸ iCloud ▸ Manage Storage.
• Turn off “Share With App Developers” in iOS Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Analytics & Improvements to stop diagnostic sharing.

If you contact us asking for deletion, we can only instruct you on the steps above, as we hold no data capable of being erased on your behalf.

5. Security

• All processing happens locally; no network transmission of your photos occurs.
• Any communication with Apple’s servers (e.g., in-app purchases) is encrypted with HTTPS/TLS.
• Apple Keychain and iCloud Backup encrypt data at rest and in transit.

6. Children

Passbild Pro is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as the App evolves. New versions will appear here and inside the App. Continued use after an update means you accept the revised policy.
